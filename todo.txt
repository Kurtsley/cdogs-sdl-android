Requested features (see also bugs.txt)
======================================

- Redesign on-screen keyboard layout dialog, to show all keys, and to use dragon droppings.

- Option for default on-screen key theme in AndroidAppSettings.cfg.

- Select between normal mouse input and magnifying glass/relative input automatically, based on screen size.

- Split Settings.java into several files.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Floating on-screen joystick - initially invisible, it appears when you touch the screen,
  centered on your finger, then it slides with your finger if you bump the joystick edge.

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3.

- Control screen brightness with SDL_SetGamma().

- Zoom in-out whole screen in SW mode with some SDL key or gesture, as in AndroidVNC. -

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard, only SW SDL screen surface supported).
  This is not relevant already, as every device around is fast enough with GL.

- Second joystick, to be used in TeeWorlds.

- OpenTTD: make English the default language, because there are no fonts for many languages.

- UQM: On-screen buttons are re-appearing when using gamepag and switching between game screens.
