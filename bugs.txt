- With 4:3 screen aspect ratio the on-screen buttons are not shown on the inactive part of screen.

- Put video at the center of the screen with 4:3 aspect ratio option

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Calling SDL_Init()/SDL_Quit() several times will make SDL 1.2 crash.

- SDL_FillRect() does not work with SDL 1.2 in HW mode (and probably with SDL 1.3 too).

- 32-bpp color mode does not work with SW video surface, 24-bpp and 32-bpp mode does not work with SDL_HWSURFACE.
